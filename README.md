# Oxide_TC

just implemented to map the full equilibrium regimes as a function of temperature and O activity

Pressure = 0.5Pa (5e-6 bar) and only Fe and O

used the BCC and Liquid phase from the TCFE11 database
used HEMATITE, MAGNETITE and WUSTITE phase from the SSUB5 database

we can update the choice of databse later
